1. Write a program to delete a node from Binary search tree.
In C++
Please run the program in Visual Studio 2015. This program includes files: 
Main.cpp; BinarySearch Tree.h; BinarySearch Tree.cpp; Node.h; Node.cpp

The program first create a binary search tree with 15 random integers. The printing output is a increasing 
rank when do the inorder traversing. Through deleting function you can delete any value from binary search tree.
If the node of value you delete is a leaf or the node you delete is actually replaced by its precessor(no metter a leaf precessor or not a leaf precessor),
the function will give a hint like "the node you delete is a leaf node" or "the replaced precessor is or not a leaf node ".

2. Write the program to do bubble sort.
In C++
Please run the program intuitively in Visual Studio 2015. This program includesfiles: Bubble sort.cpp

The random array will first be printed. 
Then do the bubble sort.For every pass of swapping(i.e traversing by the index from 0 to lenth-1, make compare and swap), 
the output will be printed.
The final sorted array will also be showed on.
