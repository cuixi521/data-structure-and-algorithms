Implement Prim's algorithm to find MST, given a graph.
In C++
Please run the program intuitively in Visual Studio 2015. This program includes files: Prim MST.cpp
1. You may hardcode the graph.  It must have at least 10 nodes and 15 edges. The edges have weights.
This program can find the minimal spanning tree of an undirected weighted graph. The MST function use
three arrays to store the messages of vertices, including whether they are in the spanning tree(visited),
their previous vetex and the minimal weight between adjacent vertices. By update the three array, the 
program find the minimal spanning tree of the graph.
